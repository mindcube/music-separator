Replace:

- `/path/to/your/audiofile.mp3` with the path to your audio file.
- `/desired/output/folder` with your target directory for saving the stems.
- `htdemucs` with your model of choice, if required.

### How It Works

1. **Argument Building:**  
   The script builds a list of command-line style arguments (including model name, device, output directory, and input file) to configure Demucs's separation process.

2. **Delegating the Separation:**  
   The main separation work is carried out by a direct call to Demucsâ€™ CLI function (`demucs_separate_main`), which processes the input file based on the provided parameters.

3. **Stem Extraction and Saving:**  
   After processing, the separated stems are saved as WAV files using `torchaudio` patched with `soundfile` to ensure the files are correctly written.
